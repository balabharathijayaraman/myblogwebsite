Up until recently, you could have a good career in technology without knowing any scripting languages. Not a great career, but a good one. Now, with the rise of cloud computing and serverless architecture, it’s imperative to know one if not two scripting languages.
Everything is moving back to the command line and API for even the most basic tasks. This doesn’t mean you have to master them, but you should know enough to automate simple tasks.
When I started in technology, learning PowerShell was how I stood out above my peers. This allowed me to pivot into IT security. Learning Python was how I developed as a security engineer, allowing me to transition into cloud environments.
If you want to learn a scripting language, but don’t know where to start, or if you already know a language but are struggling to learn another, keep reading for a few tips that will help you get started.
